=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::Backend::Serialize::JSPON::Converter - Common functionality for JSPON
expansion/collapsing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # internal

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These attributes are shared by both
L<KiokuDB::Backend::Serialize::JSPON::Converter> and
L<KiokuDB::Backend::Serialize::JSPON::Expander>.

These attributes are also available in L<KiokuDB::Backend::Serialize::JSPON>
and passed to the constructors of the expander and the collapser.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item id_field

=item class_field

=item class_meta_field

=item root_field

=item deleted_field

=item tied_field

=item data_field

=item ref_field

The various field name mappings for the L<KiokuDB::Entry> attributes.

Everything defaults to the attribute name, except C<class> and C<class_meta>
which default to C<__CLASS__> and C<__META__> for compatibility with
L<MooseX::Storage> when C<inline_data> is set, and C<ref_field> which is set to
C<$ref> according to the JSPON spec.

=item inline_data

Determines whether or not the entry data keys are escaped and the data is
stored in the same top level mapping, or inside the C<data_field> key.
