=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::Backend::Role::TXN::Memory - In memory transactions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    with qw(KiokuDB::Backend::Role::TXN::Memory);

    sub commit_entries {
        my ( $self, @entries ) = @_;

        # atomically apply @entries

        # deleted entries have the deleted flag set
        # if an entry has no 'prev' entry it's an insert
        # otherwise it's an update
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This backend provides in memory transactions for backends which support atomic
modification of data, but not full commit/rollback support.

This backend works by buffering all operations in memory. Entries are kept
alive allowing read operations go to the live entry even for objects that are
out of scope.

This implementation provides repeatable read level isolation. Durability,
concurrency and atomicity are still the responsibility of the backend.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=over 4

=item commit_entries

Insert, update or delete entries as specified.

This operation should either fail or succeed atomically.

Entries with C<deleted> should be removed from the database, entries with a
C<prev> entry should be inserted, and all other entries should be updated.

Multiple entries may be given for a single object, for instance an object that
was first inserted and then modified will have an insert entry and an update
entry.

=item get_from_storage

Should be the same as L<KiokuDB::Backend/get>.

When no memory buffered entries are available for the object one is fetched
from the backend.

=item exists_in_storage

Required as of L<KiokuDB> version 0.37.

A fallback implementation is provided, but should not be used and will issue a
deprecation warning.
