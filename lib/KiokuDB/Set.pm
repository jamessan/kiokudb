=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::Set - L<Set::Object> wrapper for KiokuDB with lazy loading.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use KiokuDB::Util qw(set);

    my $set = set(); # KiokuDB::Set::Transient

    $set->insert($object);

    warn $set->size;

    my $id = $dir->store( $set );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role defines the API implemented by L<KiokuDB::Set::Transient>,
L<KiokuDB::Set::Deferred>, and L<KiokuDB::Set::Loaded>.

These three classes are modeled after L<Set::Object>, but have implementation
details specific to L<KiokuDB>.

=head2 Transient Sets

Transient sets are in memory, they are sets that have been constructed by the
user for subsequent insertion into storage.

When you create a new set, this is what you should use.

L<KiokuDB::Util> provides convenience functions (L<KiokuDB::Util/set> and
L<KiokuDB::Util/weak_set>) to construct transient sets concisely.

=head2 Deferred Sets

When a set is loaded from the backend, it is deferred by default. This means
that the objects inside the set are not yet loaded, and will be fetched only as
needed.

When set members are needed, the set is upgraded in place into a
L<KiokuDB::Set::Loaded> object.

=head2 Loaded Sets

This is the result of vivifying the members of a deferred set, and is similar
to transient sets in implementation.
