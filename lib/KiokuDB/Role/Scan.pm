    package My::Entry::Processor;
    use Moose;

    with 'KiokuDB::Role::Scan' => { result_class => "My::Entry::Processor::Results" };

    sub process_block {
        my ( $self, %args ) = @_;

        $args{results}; # intermediate results

        foreach my $entry ( @{ $args{block} } ) {

        }
    }



    my $scan = My::Entry::Processor->new(
        backend => $some_backend,
    );

    my $res = $scan->results;

    $res->foo;

    $scan->foo; # delegates to result

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is used by classes like L<KiokuDB::LinkChecker> to scan the whole
database and computing summary results.

=head1 ROLE PARAMETERS

=item result_class

The class of the results.

Will be used when creating the results initially by calling C<new> and also
sets up an attribute with delegations.
